# Functional Purple theme for VS Code

This is my custom purple theme for VS Code.

## Install instructions

1. Clone this repository into `%USERPROFILE%\.vscode\extensions` on Windows or `~/.vscode/extensions` on MacOS or Linux.
2. Reload your VS Code window (`Crtl+Shift+P` to open the Command Pallette, type in `Reload Window` then press Enter.)

### Apply the theme

Click on Settings in the bottom-right corner, then "Colour Theme". You should see "Yavorsky Purple" as an option under "Dark Themes".
